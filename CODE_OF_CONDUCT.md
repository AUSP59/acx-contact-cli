- Initial review and response within 7 days.
- Actions may include mediation, private warnings, temporary restrictions, or bans.
- We will keep a private log of reported incidents and outcomes.

## Enforcement Guidelines
When addressing an incident, maintainers will consider community impact and severity.

Consequence: Private, written warning. Required change in behavior.

2) Warning  
Impact: A single incident or series of actions with moderate impact.  
Consequence: Temporary restrictions (e.g., no PR merges, no issues opened) for a defined period. Written warning with consequences for continued behavior.

3) Temporary Ban

Consequence: Permanent removal from all project spaces and activities.

## Confidentiality and Data Handling
- Reports are confidential and handled on a need-to-know basis.
- We will minimize data collected and retain it only as long as necessary to resolve the issue.
- Reporters may request deletion of their personal data from incident records after case closure.

## Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was made in error or unfairly, reply to the decision email with a concise appeal. A different maintainer or advisor will review when available. Appeals should present new information or context.
