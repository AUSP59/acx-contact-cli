# Frontier Certificate â€” v9.0.0

**Scope**: Local CLI, single-binary by default (0 runtime deps), optional engines (SQLite/RocksDB), reproducible builds, full OSS governance.  
**Criteria** (must all pass):
1. Functional matrix covered (CRUD, search, import/export RFC4180+JSONL, merge strategies, prune, diff, validate, doctor, backup/verify, sbom, metrics, verify-file, selftest, determinism-check).
2. Storage engines selectable and operational (jsonl by default; sqlite/rocksdb if present).
3. Concurrency-safe writes (repo lock) + atomic fs ops + journal (JSONL).
4. Security posture: HMAC backups, hardening flags, SAST (CodeQL), secret scan (Gitleaks), fuzz smoke.
5. Supply-chain: SBOM, checksums, signed artifacts, signature verification workflow.
6. Observability/ops: logs structured, JSON output modes, doctor/validate outputs JSON.
7. Reproducibility: CPack packages; deterministic round-trip (determinism-check).

**Verification**: CI `frontier-check` runs build/tests/selftest/determinism/validate.  
**Result**: All criteria satisfied as of 2025-08-20.  
**Boundary**: Any further changes with ROI material require opening a new S-surface (e.g., networked service, GUI, E2E cosign verification in client).
